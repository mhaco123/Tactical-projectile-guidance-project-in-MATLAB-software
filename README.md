# Tactical-projectile-guidance-project-in-MATLAB-software

In this project, the classical projectile guidance method has been investigated. This project and its simulation use the existing equations of geometric rules and the rules are implemented in the guidance loop.
  The trajectory of the projectile and the required acceleration have been numerically obtained and analyzed by the method of line of sight guidance, pursuit guidance and proportional navigation guidance of the moving away and approaching target. The results are compared for different speed ratios.

The three main steps of guidance are: a) solving the kinematics of the problem, including geometric relationships and obtaining acceleration, line of sight and the amount of changes in the angle of the line of sight b) implementing the law of guidance and c) stability and controlling the position of the object. The main focus of this project is implementation The cases are in two general formats: pursuit guidance and proportional navigation guidance.
